                <h5 class="text-capitalize text-success text-left">I had visited this in February 2019</h5>
                <p class="text-muted text-left"> Since bastian was trending all over Insta and I had been to the Bandra one, decided to go here! And let me admit it’s an experience!! We were trying to book it for the valentine day but it was packed. But we finally got through and the thing is they only do dinners that also are in slots so you really got to choose your time and go accordingly. As soon as you enter it’s this huge white place which looks almost another city in Mumbai. It’s very nicely done and it gives you like a comforting vibe. The food is phenomenal and the prices I would say is decently kept because for the ambience and the food it’s all worth. Also they have kinda open kitchen so you can pretty much have a look at how busy it gets but all in all the service is also pretty nice. If you wanna have a fancy dinner with your girl pals or family you should definitely give this place a visit.
                    P.s. it’s owned by Shilpa Shetty and you can expect some more celebs hanging out there too. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left"> Its not the first time that I have been here. But this restaurant is a class act. The ambiance is so comfortable and luxurious. The staff, so efficient and so pleasant and so attentive to all your needs. However crowded the restaurant its still does not seem claustrophobic. The smile on the faces of the team never fades.The food is absolutely out of the world. We were 12 of us and I dont think there was one dish that was not delicious. It was indeed a pleasant surprise too with the Bill. It was far more economical than I expected. </p>

                <p> Overall this show is really good. It introduces children to a variety of foods by exploring where they come from, how they're harvested, and how different cultures use them. Even though my 3 year old enjoys it, the humor and concepts are a little over her head. I'd say it's best for at least 4 or 5 year olds. I will mention that the potato episode refers to the potato as "ugly" numerous times in the beginning, and in the egg episode, Waffles says a chicken has a "big butt"; we don't like using those types of words or phrasing in our house, but every home is different, so that may not be an issue for you. Additionally, the catch phrase is "listen to your vegetables and eat your parents", which is silly, but also kinda weird. </p>

                <p> Dark humor, bright colors, and horror-inspired deserts make this eerie baking show more than just another spooky watch. If you’re looking for a show to pay attention to or just put on in the background this Halloween, The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell is the right show for you. </p>
